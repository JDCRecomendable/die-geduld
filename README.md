pip install pygame
```

## Playing the Game
Playing the game is straightforward and, as of current, only involves navigating around a maze. The key to winning is get to the checkpoint, avoiding the monsters around. For now, the monsters merely move either horizontally or vertically, and when the player gets hit by one, he simply returns to the starting point.

Use the arrow keys, WASD on the keyboard or the numpad keys listed below to navigate around the levels.
* `W`, `Up` or `Numpad 8`: Move Up
* `S`, `Down` or `Numpad 2`: Move Down
* `A`, `Left` or `Numpad 4`: Move Left
* `D`, `Right` or `Numpad 6`: Move Right

There are other controls included. Quitting from the game takes roughly a second, as a nice touch to fade out the music and sound effects was added when the user tries to quit.
* `R`: Reset Player Position
* `M`: Toggle Mute
* `Esc` or `Control` + `Q`: Quit from the Game

The controls will be shown everytime the game is launched.
