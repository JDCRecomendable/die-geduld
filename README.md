# die-geduld
The little game in this GitHub repository is the product of an extra/optional Computing assignment by the Computing lecturers and tutors of Yishun-Innova Junior College. Die Geduld is patience in German, and the game is named as such because it requires good hand-eye coordination and a good deal of patience in order to complete.
